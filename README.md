# Introduction
[100 FREE Frontend Challenges](https://dev.to/bigsondev/100-free-frontend-challenges-3f0?ref=dailydev)

In the spirit of building strong habits and the #100DaysOfCode idea, we decided to make our list of beautifully crafted "Design To Code" challenges publicly available, where each day you work on recreating (with your variation of course!) the original design screenshot to make it a working website/web app.

The goal is to reflect the provided design with HTML & CSS. If you want to dive deeper, adding interactivity via JS or any frameworks, libraries, or tools is more than encouraged. Maybe you can even create your next micro-SaaS out of it, who knows?

I hope you'll complete all 100 of them and land your dream job as a Web Dev! 🫡
